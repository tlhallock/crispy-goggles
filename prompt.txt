Can you create a multi workspace project in rust that has some sub projects
lobby server
	contains actix crud endpoints for a lobby which only has a list of players and boolean for if they are ready
common
	containes an object model of the lobby
	contains a grpc model of circle and rectangle shapes/filled
server
	contains a server that for now just has one endpoint to create a shape
	the shape is chosen randomly
	it uses grpc to send to any listening client notifications of the shapes shown/hidden
ui
	a leptos web app that shows a canvas with the shapes, and one button to make a shape
client
	a rust cli client that also subscribes to the grpc endpoint, and prints events.
